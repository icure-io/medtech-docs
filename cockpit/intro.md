# Introduction

## What is iCure ?

*iCure* is a trustable service ensuring the privacy of your patient medical data thanks to [end-to-end encryption](/sdks/explanations/encryption/introduction),
meaning your users are the only ones who decide who can access their data.

iCure helps you to manage the encrypted data by providing a series of easy-to-use tools :
- The **iCure Back-End** allows you to save your data into the databases and manage the access control to it based on the access
  rules you defined in your solution.
- The [**iCure Cockpit Web Portal**](../cockpit/intro) allows you to create your solutions, your databases and
  your admin users in your iCure environment.
- The **iCure Client SDKs** takes care of the [end-to-end encryption / decryption](/sdks/explanations/encryption/introduction)
  of your data and proposes you a series of easy-to-use medical-oriented services.
- The **Interoperability components** helps you to connect with external services by mapping the iCure Data Model to
  standard models like FHIR.
