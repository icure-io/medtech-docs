# Introduction

## What is iCure ?

*iCure* is a trustable service ensuring the privacy of your patient medical data thanks to [end-to-end encryption](../sdks/explanations/encryption/introduction),
meaning your users are the only ones who decide who can access their data.

iCure helps you to manage the encrypted data by providing a series of easy-to-use tools :
- The **iCure Back-End**, saving your data into the databases and managing the access control to it based on the access
  rules you defined in your app
- The **iCure Cockpit Web Portal**, allowing you to create your apps, your databases,
  your admin users, ... in your iCure environment
- The [**iCure Client SDKs**](../sdks/intro) taking care of the [end-to-end encryption / decryption](../sdks/explanations/encryption/introduction)
  of your data and proposes you a series of easy-to-use medical-oriented services
- The **Interoperability components** helping you to connect with external services by mapping the iCure Data Model to
  standard models like FHIR
