# Run the Example

You can run the example by executing the Subscriber application and then the Publisher application. Below you will 
find the instruction on how to run them in the different programming languages.

Be sure of running the Subscriber first, as the subscription will only be triggered by services created after the 
initialization.

:::warning
Both the Publisher and the Subscriber will ask for a login and a password. You can use the email and an authentication
token for a healthcare party user [created through the Cockpit](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).

Make sure to use the same credentials for both the Publisher and Subscriber. The patient created in the Publisher will 
share data with the healthcare party associated with the logged-in credentials, and the Subscriber can only access the 
services that have been shared with that same healthcare party.
:::

:::info
The Publisher and Subscriber are fully interoperable, even if they are written in different programming languages. 
For example, you could run the Publisher in Kotlin and the Subscriber in Python, and you would achieve the same result 
as if both were written in the same language.
