# Create a Patient

In iCure, a patient is represented by the `Patient` entity. In the following example, the user reads a first name and
last name from the standard input and creates a patient:

<SdkCode>
   <Kotlin>
{`print("First name: ")
val firstName = readln().trim()
print("Last name: ")
val lastName = readln().trim()
val patient = DecryptedPatient(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	firstName = firstName,
	lastName = lastName,
)
`}
   </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

A `Patient` is an encryptable entity, meaning it will be encrypted on the device that creates it and then sent
encrypted to the cloud. Since it is decrypted at the moment of creation, a `DecryptedPatient` is instantiated. Besides
`firstName` and `lastName`, the `id` must also be set on the entity. Using a
[UUID v4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) is strongly recommended.

Next, the metadata required for the encryption of the entity must be initialized:

<SdkCode>
   <Kotlin>
{`val patientWithMetadata = sdk.patient.withEncryptionMetadata(patient)`}
   </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

This step is mandatory and also sets up a delegation for the user creating the entity, who will initially be the only
one able to read the entity's encrypted fields.

After this step, the entity can finally be encrypted and stored in the cloud:

<SdkCode>
   <Kotlin>
{`val createdPatient = sdk.patient.createPatient(patientWithMetadata)`}
   </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

Once created, the entity can be modified. In the following example, a date of birth is read from the standard input
and added to the patient:

<SdkCode>
   <Kotlin>
{`print("Date of birth (YYYYMMDD): ")
val dateOfBirth = readln().toInt()
val patientWithBirth = createdPatient.copy(
	dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth
)
val updatedPatient = sdk.patient.modifyPatient(patientWithBirth)`}
   </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

The date of birth in the patient is stored in the `dateOfBirth` field as an integer in the `YYYYMMDD` format. It is worth
noting that since the entity is already created and the encryption metadata are already initialized, there is no need
to call `withEncryptionMetadata` again.

After creation, it is also possible to retrieve the entity from the cloud. In the following example, the patient
is retrieved using its ID:

<SdkCode>
   <Kotlin>
{`println("Retrieving patient by ID:")
val retrievedPatient = sdk.patient.getPatient(updatedPatient.id)`}
   </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

More advanced methods for retrieving entities are available and will be explained in [another section](TODO) of this
tutorial and [in more depth here](TODO).
