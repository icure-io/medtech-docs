# Initialize the SDK

After you have [created a first database and a healthcare party user with a token](/nsdk/tutorial/basic/sdk-basic-tutorial),
you can use those credentials to instantiate a new iCure SDK.
In the following example, the username and password are retrieved from the standard input:

<SdkCode>
    <Kotlin>
{`import com.icure.sdk.IcureSdk
import com.icure.sdk.options.AuthenticationMethod
import com.icure.sdk.storage.impl.FileStorageFacade\n
private const val ICURE_URL = "https://api.icure.cloud"\n
print("Login: ")
val username = readln().trim()
print("Password: ")
val password = readln().trim()
val sdk = IcureSdk.initialize(
	applicationId = null,
	baseUrl = ICURE_URL,
	authenticationMethod = AuthenticationMethod.UsingCredentials(
		UsernamePassword(username, password)
	),
	baseStorage = FileStorageFacade("./scratch/storage")
)`}
    </Kotlin>
</SdkCode>

The `initialize` function creates an instance of the SDK with the provided username and password. It also attempts to
load existing cryptographic keys for the user from the `./scratch/storage` folder. If no key is found for the user in
that folder, a new cryptographic key will be generated and stored there.
