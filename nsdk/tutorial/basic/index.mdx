# iCure SDK Introductory Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will discover how the iCure solution can be used in common digital health scenarios to create,
search and share medical data.
Before starting, be sure to follow the [onboarding procedure](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-create-your-account) to register to
iCure and create database and [create a healthcare party user to the database](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).

:::note
Be sure to [generate an authentication token](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp#generating-an-authentication-token) (i.e.
a temporary password) for your healthcare party to be able to instantiate the SDK in the code examples.

The full code examples is available [in this repo](TODO), where you will find a folder for each language.
