# Cardinal SDK Introductory Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will discover how the Cardinal solution can be used in common digital health scenarios to create,
search and share medical data.

Before starting, be sure to follow the [onboarding procedure](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-create-your-account) to register to
Cardinal and create database and [create a healthcare party user to the database](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).

:::note
Be sure to [generate an authentication token](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp#generating-an-authentication-token) (i.e.
a temporary password) for your healthcare party to be able to instantiate the SDK in the code examples.
