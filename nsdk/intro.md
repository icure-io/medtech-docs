# Introduction

This section contains a preview of the documentation for an upcoming major release of the iCure SDK.

In our ongoing effort to improve iCure this new SDK will come with significant changes both internally and externally,
in the user-facing api. The core principles and general features showcased in the [EHR lite](/ehr-lite-sdk/intro) and
[Medtech](/medtech-sdk/intro) pages still apply to the new version, however the exact functions you can use to access
these features will be different.

The python version of the new SDK is currently released as a preview version at [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/icure-sdk/#history).
