# SubContact

A SubContact is an encryptable nested entity that is used to link [Contact](/explanations/data-model/contact)s and
[Service](/explanations/data-model/service)s to other structuring element that can provide an additional medical
context, such as [HealthElement](/explanations/data-model/healthelement), healthcare approach (PlanOfAction), or
medical forms.

SubContacts are nested in the Contact entity, in the `subContacts` field.
