# Topic

A Topic is an encryptable, root-level entity that can be used in combination with the [Message](/explanations/data-model/message) 
entity to implement chat-like messaging systems.

## Fields Encrypted by Default
By default, the following fields of this entity will be encrypted:
- `description`
- `linkedServices`
- `linkedHealthElements`

You can customize the encrypted fields as [explained in this how to](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/configure-what-to-encrypt).

## Link to Messages
A Topic does not contain any reference to the messages that are part of it. This link is contained in the messages 
themselves, as the `transportGuid` field should be set to the id of the Topic.

Note that the Cardinal backend does not enforce this behaviour.

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the
[shared fields](/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the reference documentation (:construction:).
