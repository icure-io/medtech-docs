# Identifier

An Identifier is a non-encryptable nested entity that is used in the `identifiers` field of other entities to 
uniquely identify them and link them to external resources, as specified in the [FHIR documentation](https://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Identifier).

:::note
The Cardinal backend does not enforce the uniqueness of a defined Identifier for any type of entity.
:::

Identifier's `system` and `value` can be used to [search data using filters](/how-to/querying-data).

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the
[shared fields](/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the reference documentation (:construction:).

### assigner
If this Identifier was issued by an external organization, this field should contain the name of that organization.

### system
The namespace of this identifier. According to the FHIR specification, if the system value is a URL, then it must be
possible to resolve it.

### type
A [CodeStub](/explanations/data-model/codestub) that defines the type of this identifier with respect to a
codification system.

### value
The value of the identifier. It must be unique within the namespace defined in the `system`.
