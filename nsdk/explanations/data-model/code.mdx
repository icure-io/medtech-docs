# Code

A Code is a non-encryptable root-level entity that represents a concept from a medical codification system (e.g., 
[SNOMED-CT](https://www.snomed.org/what-is-snomed-ct), [LOINC](https://loinc.org/)), or an internal codification. Codes 
support versioning and multilingual content. 

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the 
[shared fields](/nsdk/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the [references](TODO).

### id
Uniquely identifies the Code. Differently from all the other entities, where the id should be a
[UUID v4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)), the id of the Code should be
`type|code|version`, where `type`, `code`, and `version` are the values of the homonymous properties.

### type 
The type of the Code is the classification system where the code come from (e.g. `SNOMED-CT`, `LOINC`). All the codes 
from the same source should have the same type. 

For internal codes, you can choose any value you prefer.

### code
A value that uniquely identifies the code inside the system. For example, the illness "Besnier's prurigo" is uniquely
defined by the code `200773006` in SNOMED and by the code `L20.0` in ICD-10.

### version
The version of the code, useful if you want to update a Code in your system (e.g. because an update in label or meaning)
while also keeping the outdated version.

As for the format, you can use either [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) or any version format that can be 
ordered lexicographically (e.g. the date of the publishing of the version in `YYYYMMDD` format).

### label 
Associates an [ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) and a human-readable 
description of the code in that language. The label and the search terms will be taken into account when searching
codes by label.

### region
A collection of regions where the code is applicable. It may be the [ISO code of the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)
or any code that can define a region in a country.

### searchTerms
Associates an [ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) with a collection of
words in that language that are related to the code. The label and the search terms will be taken into account when searching
codes by label.
