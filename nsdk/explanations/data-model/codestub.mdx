# CodeStub

A CodeStub is a non-encryptable nested entity that represent a reference to a [Code](/explanations/data-model/code). 
It can be nested in many different entities, most commonly in the `tag` and `code` filter, and it is used to link a Code 
to it without having to include the whole Code.

The `id`, `type`, `code`, and `version` fields of a CodeStub must match the ones of the Code it references.
