# Encryptable entities links

Some types of encryptable entities are linked with other encryptable entities.
For example, each `Contact` is always linked to a `Patient`.

In most applications, you will need to "navigate" these links.
This is the case, for example, if you want to find all contacts assigned to a certain patient, or find the patient that
a certain contact refers to.


The nature of these links is always one-to-many (for example)

Encrypted links are used to represent one-to-many relationship between entities in a secure yet still usable way.

The encrypted link works by using secret ids. For each entity that can be on the one side of a one-to-many relationship we have a secret id, which is stored encrypted in the entity itself. This secret id will be added to the many linked entities, allowing for any user with access to the secret id of the one entity to search for the linked entities.

:::note

It is possible for a single entity to have multiple secret ids, which is useful in cases where you want to better separate the health data of patients that needs to be accessible to different groups of data owners. This however is a more advanced topic and won't be covered in this page.

You can use filters to find the many entities linked through secret ids to a one entity, for example you can create a filter to get all the health elements linked to a patient in the following way:
