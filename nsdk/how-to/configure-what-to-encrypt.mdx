# Configuring what is encrypted

TODO

## Cost of encryption

- Encrypted data is note queryable
- If you encrypt too much your data you will need access to the encrypted content to make use of the data you collect,
  which may be bad for the trust with end users. If what you want to use is not critical for privacy of the end user you
  may want to leave it unencrypted.

## Warnings

- Make sure to use the same configuration across all instances of your app
- When working with encrypted entities make sure to not modify data that should be encrypted according to your
  configuration. There are measures to help prevent these mistakes but they can't always detect them.
- Uses json names of the entity fields (something_something in python is somethingSomething in json)

## Tips

Minimum security suggested is:
- encrypt link between patient and medical data
- encrypt free text field (may contain identifying info)
- encrypt raw documents (pdf, png, may contain identifying info)
