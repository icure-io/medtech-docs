# Basic operations

When using the Cardinal SDK you will be working mostly with end-to-end encrypted data.
The patients, the encounters with practitioners, diagnoses, appointments, the exam results and more.
All the entities used to represent these concepts are at least in part encrypted to protect the privacy of the end 
users.

Usually end-to-end encryption comes with many challenges, but the Cardinal SDK abstracts this complexity away, allowing
you to work almost as if there was no encryption happening.

In this page we cover the basic operations that you can do when working with the Cardinal SDK

## Creating new entities

The entities creation is done in two steps: you first initialize an instance of the entity, setting some metadata if
needed and the content, then you can "commit" the creation of the entity to save it in the backend.  

You can initialize an unencrypted entity using the constructor of the corresponding model class.

TODO code sample

For encrypted entities, however, you have to use the initialization method provided by that entity api.
This method will initialize some metadata needed for the encryption and access control of the entity.

TODO code sample with no params

To commit the creation of the entity use the `create` method from the corresponding api passing the initialized entity.

### Encryptable entity initialization parameters

## Retrieving entities

## Updating entities

## Delete

- Warning: delete is soft delete - hides from search but not from get by id.

## Flavours


- WARNING: When working with encrypted entities make sure to not modify data that should be encrypted according to your
  configuration. There are measures to help prevent these mistakes but they can't always detect them.
