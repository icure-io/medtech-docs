# How to subscribe to events ?

## Introduction

In some cases, you may want to react to the creation or update of data in Cardinal. Since this data is encrypted,
we cannot host this code in Cardinal. That's why we provide you with the tools to implement a microservice/backend
that can subscribe to these different events and react accordingly.

## Example use cases

- Analyze a measurement taken on a patient using a machine learning model
- Send an email to a patient when a new appointment is created
- Update a patient's status in an external system when their health status changes
- etc.

## Setup

You will need to host a service that can subscribe to these events using the Cardinal SDK. The service
in question must have access to the events, so you will need to share health data with the user that
will be used by the service.

In this example, we will focus on the code used to subscribe to events. Let's start by creating a service
that subscribes to the creation of new `HealthElement` objects with the tag `INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS` having the value
`TO_BE_STARTED` and logs them in the console.

The `subscribeToEvents` method allows you to subscribe to the creation events of an
`HealthElement`. In this example, we filter the events to receive only those with the tag type `INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS`
and the tag code `TO_BE_STARTED`.

This method returns a `ReceiveChannel` that allows us to consume the events.

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.filters.ServiceFilters
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.subscription.EntitySubscriptionConfiguration
import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.consumeEach

sdk.healthElement.subscribeToEvents (
	setOf(SubscriptionEventType.Create),
	HealthElementFilters.byTagForSelf(
		tagType = "INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS",
		tagCode = "TO_BE_STARTED",
	),
	EntitySubscriptionConfiguration(
		channelBufferCapacity = 100,
		onBufferFull = EntitySubscriptionConfiguration.FullBufferBehaviour.Close,
		reconnectionDelay = 2.seconds,
		retryDelayExponentFactor = 2.0,
		connectionMaxRetries = 5,
	)
).eventChannel.consumeEach {
	println("HealthElement created: $it")
}
```

:::note

This code needs to be executed in a coroutine context. The part managing this has been omitted
for simplicity.

The `subscribeToEvents` method allows you to subscribe to the creation events of an
`HealthElement`. In this example, we filter the events to receive only those with the tag type `INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS`
and the tag code `TO_BE_STARTED`.

This method returns an `EntitySubscription` that allows us to consume the events.

To consume the events, we use the `waitForEvent` method, which lets us wait for an event for a certain time. If no event
is received, the method returns `null`.

We loop as long as the `EntitySubscription` is not closed.

```typescript
import {
	EntitySubscriptionConfiguration,
	ServiceFilters,
} from "@icure/cardinal-sdk";

const subscription = await sdk.healthElement.subscribeToEvents(
	[SubscriptionEventType.Create],
	HealthElementFilters.byTagForSelf(
		'INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS',
		{
			tagCode: 'TO_BE_STARTED',
		},
	),
	{
		subscriptionConfig: new EntitySubscriptionConfiguration(
			{
				channelBufferCapacity: 100,
				onBufferFull: EntitySubscriptionConfiguration.FullBufferBehaviour.Close,
				reconnectionDelay: 2 * 1000,
				retryDelayExponentFactor: 2.0,
				connectionMaxRetries: 5,
			},
		),
	},
)

while (!subscription.isClosed) {
	const event = await subscription.waitForEvent(10 * 1000)
	if (event !== null) {
		console.log(`Received event: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`)
	} else {
		console.log('No new event yet')
	}
}
```

The `subscribe_to_events_blocking` method allows you to subscribe to the creation events of an
`HealthElement`. In this example, we filter the events to receive only those with the tag type `INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS`
and the tag code `TO_BE_STARTED`.

This method returns an `EntitySubscription` that allows us to consume the events.

To consume the events, we use the `wait_for_event_blocking` method, which lets us wait for an event for a
certain time. If no event is received, the method returns `None`.

We loop as long as the `EntitySubscription` is not closed.

```python
from cardinal_sdk.filters import ServiceFilters
from cardinal_sdk.model import EntitySubscriptionConfiguration
from datetime import timedelta

subscription = sdk.health_element.subscribe_to_events_blocking(
	[SubscriptionEventType.Create],
	HealthElementFilters.by_tag_for_self(
		"INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS",
		"TO_BE_STARTED",
	),
	EntitySubscriptionConfiguration(
		channel_buffer_capacity=100,
		on_buffer_full=EntitySubscriptionConfiguration.FullBufferBehaviour.Close,
		reconnection_delay=timedelta(seconds=5),
		retry_delay_exponent_factor=2.0,
		connection_max_retries=5,
	)
)

while subscription.get_close_reason() is None:
	event = subscription.wait_for_event_blocking(timedelta(seconds=10))
	if event is not None:
		print(event)
	else:
		print("No new event yet")
```

:::info

All events received by the SDK are encrypted. Therefore, you will need to decrypt them before processing.

## Some explanations

### Buffered events

We have completely abstracted the various concepts used to establish the connection and consume events.
The goal is to provide you with a tool that allows you to react to events without worrying about setting up
a WebSocket connection, handling connection errors, etc.

Events are sent by the Cardinal backend, and this event is then added to a buffer. You can specify
the size of this buffer and the behavior to adopt if the buffer is full.

This buffer contains events that have not yet been consumed. An event can be:
- A connection event (emitted once during the initial connection)
- An error event:
	- An error event due to a missed ping from the server
	- An error event due to backend closure
	- An unexpected error event
- A reconnection event (automatically initiated in case of a non-fatal error)
- An event with an entity (Service, Contact, etc.) that has been created or modified (depending on your filter)
- A deserialization error event (if an event cannot be deserialized)

This mechanism allows you to continue consuming events even if the connection is lost, without losing
those already collected before the connection loss.

We will provide a more complete example later in this document.

### Ping mechanism

Cardinal SDK uses a ping mechanism to check the connection with the backend. This ping/pong is initiated by the backend
after receiving the subscription message from the client.

The client must respond to this ping with a pong within a given time window. If the client does not respond,
the backend considers the connection lost and closes the connection. Conversely, the client expects to receive
a ping from the backend within a given time window. If the client does not receive a ping, it considers
the connection lost and closes the connection.

In both cases, the client attempts to reconnect automatically in the event of a connection loss. You can specify
the reconnection delay, the reconnection delay exponent factor, and the number of reconnection attempts.

If, after the number of reconnection attempts, the connection cannot be restored, a close event is emitted
with the reason for the closure.

### Close reasons

Possible close reasons are as follows:
- `ChannelFull`: The buffer is full, and the close behavior is set to `Close`
- `ConnectionLost`: The connection was lost, and the maximum number of reconnection attempts was reached
- `IntentionallyClosed`: The connection was intentionally closed by the client
  Dans le cas où le nombre de tentatives de reconnexion est atteint, la connexion est fermée. Vous pouvez consultez la raison
  de la fermeture de la connexion et réagir en conséquence.

## Advanced usage

Now that we know the basics, we can determine how to handle different error cases and enable your service
to react accordingly.

### Recover from a connection error

During a connection issue, the SDK automatically attempts to reconnect. You can respond to the `Reconnected` event upon
receiving it.

Our documentation focuses on practical aspects, so how to react to this event shouldn't be directly copied in a production
environment. You will need to adapt your recovery strategy based on your environment and how you consume events. Feel 
free to reach out to us to discuss your use case and the best way to get back on track after a reconnection.

In our case, the approach is as follows: upon the `Connected` or `Reconnected` event, we attempt to retrieve the missed
events, a process handled by the `getMissedEvents` / `get_missed_event` method.

`getMissedEvents` / `get_missed_event` allows for retrieving missed events by filtering them using `filterHealthElementsBy`
/ `filter_health_elements_by_blocking`.

Each processed element is added to a queue for handling, and once an element is processed, it is updated with a new tag 
`INTERNAL_INFERENCE_STATUS` with the value `DONE`, and therefore will no longer match the initial filter.

At application startup, we retrieve the missed events and process them. We then wait for new events and process them as
they come. If a reconnection event is received, we retrieve and process the missed events.

In this example, the number of reconnection attempts is limited to 5. If the limit is reached, the connection will be closed.
