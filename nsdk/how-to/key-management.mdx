# Key management and data recovery 

The Cardinal SDK uses end-to-end encryption to protect your end-users' data, ensuring that only the original creator and
their authorized users can decrypt it.
Neither the Cardinal team nor you will be able to access the encrypted data unless explicitly authorized by the creator.

A drawback of this approach, however, is that if the user loses their key, they will also lose access to their data, and
neither you nor the cardinal team can help to recover it.

When using the Cardinal SDK you should educate the user on the importance of their key, and provide backup and recovery
solutions to prevent catastrophic loss of data. 
The Cardinal SDK provides support for different backup and recovery options so that you can use the best solution for 
your application.

In general, there are three categories of approaches you can take:
- Create backup of the user keys
- Share data with multiple users and ask for access back in case of key loss
- Use the notary system to safely share a backup of the key with other people
  
:::danger

If a user loses their key and can't get it back through a backup or through notaries, any data they've created and 
haven't shared with other users will be permanently lost.

:::

## Creating and using key backups

The Cardinal SDK automatically stores and retrieves keys using the (key) storage facade provided during initialization.
However, if the storage is cleared, you will need to recover the user's keys before they can access their data. 
This could occur, for instance, if you're building a web app that uses local storage, and the user deletes their 
browsing data.
In mobile or desktop applications, this might happen if the user changes their device.

To prevent data loss, we recommend including a solution in your application to export/backup and recover user keys 
before release.

### Exporting available keys

You can use the `currentDataOwnerKeys` method from the crypto api to access all the keys for the current data owner 
available to the SDK.
If you're using [hierarchical data owners](/how-to/share-data-with-many-users) the SDK will also give all keys available 
for parent data owners.

The method returns the keys as a map `data owner id (self or parent) → key fingerprint → private key in pkcs8 format`.
You can export the keys any way you think fits your application, but we suggest keeping this structure as it will 
simplify the re-import process.

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

On kotlin/jvm we can encode the map as json, encoding the pkcs8 key bytes as base64, then save it to a file 

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.utils.base64Encode
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext
import kotlinx.serialization.encodeToString
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json
import java.io.FileWriter

suspend fun exportKeysToFile(
	sdk: CardinalSdk,
	filename: String
) {
	val encodedKeys = sdk.crypto.currentDataOwnerKeys().mapValues { (_, keysByFingerprint) ->
		keysByFingerprint.mapValues { (_, pkcs8Key) ->
			pkcs8Key.base64Encode()
		}
	}.let { Json.encodeToString(it) }
	withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
		FileWriter(filename).use { fw -> fw.write(encodedKeys) }
	}
}
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

### Restore keys backups

During initialization, the Cardinal SDK automatically checks if all the keys of the current data owner (and parents) are
available.
If one or more keys are missing, the SDK will try to use the `CryptoStrategies` to recover any missing keys.

:::note

In this how-to we cover only the basic principles of key recovery. 
We recommend reading the [crypto strategies](/explanations/crypto-strategies) documentation to have a better 
understanding about how to customize the way the Cardinal SDK manages the user keys and handles end-to-end encryption.

:::

You can provide custom crypto strategies to the api initialization method that allow the user to re-import keys exported
using a past instance of the SDK.

<LanguageTabs>

### Export newly created key

During initialization, the SDK ensures that the logged user has at least a key available. 
If the user doesn't have a key, or if none of their keys was found in the storage or recovered by the crypto strategies,
the SDK needs to create a new key.

When this happens, the SDK uses the `generateNewKeyForDataOwner` to confirm to notify your application that a new key
is necessary and confirm that this is allowed by your application logic.
You can use this method to prompt the user to export the newly created key.

:::note

The SDK can only create a new key for the current data owner.
If you're using hierarchical data owners, and there is no key available for one of the parent data owners, the SDK
initialization will fail.

:::


#### Example: export after initialization

In this example, we mark in the crypto strategies if a key was generated, then after initialization we check if a new
key was generated and ask the user if they want to export it.

### Keys backup representation

Exporting the keys of the user as files, like shown in the previous examples, can work in desktop applications.
However, managing files on a mobile device is often a cumbersome operation.
A more user-friendly solution for mobile applications could be to use QR codes: you could allow your users to instantly
recover keys using a QR code generated in the past, or generated on-the-fly by another device that has the key.
However, if you try to generate a QR code for an RSA key, you can see that the resulting code is quite big, and older or 
low-end devices may have troubles reading it.

To help with this issue, you can use the recovery data system of the Cardinal SDK.
The recovery data system allows storing encrypted data on the Cardinal backend using a small encryption key (AES-128 or
AES-256 &rarr; 16 or 32 bytes).
Your user can create recovery data containing his private keys and save the encryption key for the recovery data 
somewhere.
At a later moment, if the user loses their private keys, they can login and use the recovery data key to get them back.

This way, instead of having to provide all the missing keys the user has to provide only the recovery data key.
This allows recovery with smaller QR codes, or even with manual input if you encode the recovery key using 
human-friendly representation such as base32.

### Multi-device key management

If a user is using the cardinal SDK from multiple devices, you should make sure the same private keys are available on
both devices.
If the same user is logged in on two different devices with different available private keys, the data available on a
device could be different from the data available on the other. 

To prevent this situation from happening, we suggest that you provide a simple way to copy keys from a device to another.
For example, you could use the recovery data mechanism explained previously to create some short-lived key recovery
data.

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.crypto.entities.RecoveryKeySize

suspend fun createShortRecoveryDataAndPrintKey(

) {
	val recoveryKey = sdk.recovery.createRecoveryInfoForAvailableKeyPairs(
		includeParentsKeys = true,
		// We want to use a shorter recovery data key to simplify the transfer
		recoveryKeySize = RecoveryKeySize.Bytes16,
		// Since we're creating this recovery data only to transfer keys between devices,
		// we should give it a limited lifespan
		lifetimeSeconds = 5 * 60
	)
	println("Your temporary recovery key is: ${recoveryKey.asBase32().chunked(4).joinToString("-")}")
	// Your temporary recovery key is: NQ2I-HTJ7-Y3CK-GUIH-EMKK-M7CY-HA
}
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>


## Regaining access to shared data after key loss

If the user has completely lost their key, and can't recover it, they could still be able to regain access to their
data if they had previously shared it with other users.

The user will have to create a new keypair during the initialization of the SDK, then notify the other users that he
shared data with (or that shared data with him) that he needs access back to the entities.
We call this a "give access back" request.
You can do this using some external method that suits your application, or internally to the Cardinal SDK by using
maintenance tasks.

Now the recipient of the give-access-back can respond to it and give back access to the user: this can be done either 
directly by updating the give-access-back with the new public key of the requester, or indirectly by using the recovery
data system.

:::info

Both give-access-back solutions don't need to directly update the medical data.
Even if you have thousands of contacts and patients with different encryption keys shared between the sender and
recipient of the give-access-back request, there is no need to update them to resolve the request.

The only entities updated by the give-access-back request are the metadata entities used to store the 
[exchange keys](/explanations/cryptography-details).

:::

### Indirect give-access-back with recovery data

The recovery data mechanism explained earlier for recovery of private keys can also be used with the give-access-back
mechanism.
In this case, the recipient of the give-access-back request can create recovery data containing the decrypted
[exchange keys](/explanations/cryptography-details) between the sender and recipient of the request.
The recipient can now share the recovery data key with the sender, which the sender can use to access again all exchange
keys, and in turn all entities, shared between them.

import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk

// Used by the recipient of the give-access-back request
suspend fun createRecoveryDataForGiveAccessBackAndPrint(
	sdk: CardinalSdk,
	dataOwnerWithLostKeyId: String
) {
	val recoveryKey = sdk.recovery.createExchangeDataRecoveryInfo(delegateId = dataOwnerWithLostKeyId)
	println("Share this recovery key with $dataOwnerWithLostKeyId: ${recoveryKey.asBase32()}")
}

//Used by the sender of the give-access-back after getting a recovery key
suspend fun useRecoveryDataFromGiveAccessBack(
	sdk: CardinalSdk,
	recoveryKey: String
) {
	val recoveryResult = sdk.recovery.recoverExchangeData(RecoveryDataKey.fromBase32(recoveryKey))

:::info

When using the exchange data recovery key the SDK will automatically update the exchange data between the sender and 
recipient of the give-access-back request, so that the sender can access it with their new private key.

:::

### Direct give-access-back using new public key

If the give-access-back request includes the public key of the sender, then the recipient can directly update the
[exchange keys](/explanations/cryptography-details) to allow the sender to access them through their new personal key.

This could be done, for example, if the give-access-back request was done through maintenance tasks:

We strongly recommend using this give-access-back solution only if you're using external solutions to verify the
authenticity of the public keys stored in the Cardinal backend.

For more information, we recommend reading the [end-to-end encryption explanation page](/explanations/end-to-end-encryption) 

:::

## Notary system

:construction: This section is under construction :construction:

The notary system is an alternative to key backups.
Instead of (or in addition to) a private backup of the key, a user can designate a group of trusted notaries that each 
will hold a piece of the user's private key.
If the user loses his key, he can ask the notaries for the piece of key they were holding and reconstruct the full key.

At its base, this system uses [shamir's secret sharing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing).
This allows also specifying a threshold of pieces needed to reconstruct the keys that is lower than the number of pieces
created.
This system is safer than directly sharing a key backup or medical data because even if some notaries (depending on the
chosen threshold) become untrustworthy, the data remains secure.

The notaries system enables secure data recovery even when the data was never explicitly shared with other users, a 
critical requirement for some systems. 
For instance, consider a Cardinal-based EHR application used by a solo GP. 
The data is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the GP can read it.
If the GP were to go missing, patient data would be lost permanently, which would not only be a disservice to most 
patients but could also delay treatment to patients with life-threatening conditions.
However, if the GP had designated notaries, the private key can be recovered, allowing access to patient data even in 
this extreme scenario.
