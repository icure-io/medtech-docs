# Overview

This page gives an overview of the main features of the iCure SDK.

## Initialise your app on cockpit

Before you can start coding you will need to create your application databases and master user from the cockpit.
You can follow the [onboarding procedure](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-start) using the demo setup to do this.

:::info

The demo setup will provide you with information such as `EXTERNAL_SERVICES_SPEC_ID` and `EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION_PROCESS_ID`.
These values are used for the autonomous registration of new users and for the passwordless login (using an email/sms
totp), however these procedures are not yet supported in the current SDK preview build.

:::

## Initialising the SDK

Before you can start working with the medical data you will need to initialise an instance of the iCure SDK. The
initialisation process will perform the login to the iCure backend and load or initialise the cryptographic keys.

To initialise the SDK you will need:
1. The URL of the iCure backend. In order to allow our users to comply with various regulations we have multiple
deployments of iCure, some of which are frozen at specific versions. You can use `https://api.icure.cloud` which always
points to the latest deployment of the backend.
2. The credentials of your user. You can create new users and get a temporary login token for new and existing users
through the cockpit ([tutorial](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp))
3. An implementation of `CryptoStrategies`, which allow you to customise the behaviour of iCure when performing
cryptographic operations. In the following example we provide an implementation of crypto strategies that does not
perform any custom key recovery operation, puts full trust on the server, and configures the SDK to use anonymous
delegations for all non-hcp users but you may want to do things differently in your real application. You can learn more
about the crypto strategies [here](/ehr-lite-sdk/explanations/crypto-strategies)
4. A data storage solution, which will be used by the sdk to persistently store keys and other information. By default,
the same storage solution is used to store both keys (exported as bytes and encoded) and other data, but you can provide
two different storage implementations if you want.

You can also provide other optional parameters that you can provide to configure the SDK, for example you can specify
for each encryptable entity which fields should be encrypted.

## Overview on entities

### Introduction to the data model

In this chapter we will briefly introduce the most common entities in iCure.

#### User

A user represents an actor that can login to iCure and perform some operations.

#### Data owner

A data owner is an actor that can manage medical data. All data owners have personal cryptographic keys that are used in
the sharing of data with other data owners.

Most users are also data owners and most data owners are also users, but this is not always the case.

For example, you can have a non-data-owner user, which can still perform some operations on medical data, depending on
its permissions, however it will not be able to create or decrypt any encrypted data as it lacks any cryptographic
capabilities.

Alternatively you could have a data owner for a clinic, which holds a cryptographic key that is shared between all
doctors practicing in that clinic. Since there is no person or application acting as the clinic then there is no reason
to have a user linked to this data owner,

In iCure data owner can be either a `HealthcareParty` or `Patient`, and a data owner user will always be linked to one
of these two entities.

#### HealthcareParty (often shortened to hcp)

A healthcare party represent a professional actor that takes part in the management of the health of the patient.
This could be a physical person, such as a nurse or a doctor, or an organisation such as a hospital or a
medical analysis laboratory. A healthcare party can be a user, but this is not always the case.

An healthcare party in iCure is similar to `Organisation` or `Practitioner` in FHIR

#### Patient

An actor that receives some form of medical care. Patients in iCure can also be data owners.

#### Contact and services

Services are at the main way of storing medical data and events in iCure, such as measurements, laboratory results,
or observations made by a practitioner. Services are performed in a precise moment in time and always in the context of a
Contact, which could be for example a doctor visit. Therefore, services are always contained within a contact. A contact
and its services are always linked to exactly one patient.

A contact in iCure is similar to an `Encounter` in FHIR. A service instead could be different FHIR entities depending on
the service being performed, with some common ones being `Observation` and `Immunization`

#### Health element

A health element represent some information that was in some way derived from services, such as a diagnosis.
Observations are often linked to services, and have often a lasting duration. Health elements are always linked to
exactly one patient.

A health element is similar to a `Condition` in FHIR.

#### CodeStub

Code stubs are short identifiers that link to more descriptive information. Code stubs could either link to some
international terminology standards such as SnomedCT or LOINC, or they could use some internal convention.

Most entities can have two collections of code stubs, to represent either "tags" or "codes", which can be useful for
filtering purposes. You should use tags to define some information on the class of the item, and you should use codes to
provide information on that specific instance. For example you can have a service for the COVID-19 vaccine
administration with a tag for [LOINC 30956-7 (Vaccine)](https://loinc.org/30956-7), and a code
[SNOMED 28531000087107 (covid vaccine)](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=28531000087107&edition=MAIN/2024-07-01&release=&languages=en&latestRedirect=false).

### Encryptable entities

All entities in iCure fall in two main categories depending on whether they are encryptable or not.

Some types of entities like `Patient`, `HealthElement`, or `Contact` support end-to-end encryption, while others like
`HealthcareParty` or `Code` do not, but this is not the only distinction between these two kinds of entities. An
important difference is that access control is entity-based for encryptable entities and role-based for the others.

This means for example that if a user has the permission to get HealthcareParties then the user can get any
`HealthcareParty`. If the user also has the permission to modify HealthcareParties then he can modify any
`HealthcareParty`. These permissions are not restricted to a specific instance of `HealthcareParty`.

:::info

You can change the roles assigned by default to a specific class of user (e.g. hcp or patient) through the cockpit.
You can also assign different roles to each users. We are going to release documentation page with all the available
roles and corresponding permissions in the future.

:::

Instead, for encryptable entities the permissions are applied individually to each entity. For example a data owner may be
allowed to get `ContactA` or `ContactB`, but he may not be allowed to get `ContactC`. The same data owner may also be allowed
to modify `ContactA` but not `ContactB`. The permission to access to encrypted data of the entity and to the ids of
linked entities (e.g. the id of the patient that is the subject of a contact) also applies to each entity separately.

## Working with encryptable entities

### Creating an encryptable entity

Before you can create an encryptable entity you first need to initialise its encryption metadata. If you use the
`create` method passing in input an entity with uninitialised metadata you will get a runtime error.

In most cases the encryption metadata initialisation methods only take optional parameters, for example in the case
of the patient api method you can pass:
- A base for the entity to initialise. The entity with initialised metadata will copy its content from the base. If not
passed the returned entity will only have the id and encryption metadata set. You can always modify the content of the
initialised entity later.
- Initial delegates for the entity, which is a map of other data owners (and corresponding access level) that will
immediately have access to the entity as soon as it is created. You can always share an entity with the other data
owners later, but if you know already you want to share the entity with someone else it would be better to do it
immediately, especially if you want the other data owners to be able to get realtime `Create` notifications for the
entity.
- Your current user if you want to use the auto-delegations set on the user in addition to any initial delegate provided.


<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`from icure.model import DecryptedPatient, AccessLevel
import uuid\n
patient_with_initialised_metadata = sdk.patient.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(
    base=DecryptedPatient(
        # You should use a uuid implementation with a random source that is suitable for cryptographic operations.
        # The uuid of most implementations of python uuid is good for this purpose, but this is not a requirement in the
        # documentation. We will provide an implementation of uuid v4 generator which guarantees this requirement in a
        # future release.
        id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        first_name="John",
        last_name="Smith",
        date_of_birth=19930805,
        note="If you use the default configuration this will be encrypted end-to-end"
    ),
    # The data will be shared with the data owner corresponding to organisationId
    delegates={organisationId:AccessLevel.Write}
)
created_patient = sdk.patient.create_patient_blocking(patient_with_initialised_metadata)`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

Some entities have encrypted links to other entities, for example each `Contact` and `HealthElement` must always be
linked to a patient, and for security reasons this link is encrypted. We will provide more information about encrypted
links in a later chapter.

When initialising the encryption metadata of an entity with an encrypted link you also have to provide the linked entity.

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`from icure.model import DecryptedHealthElement\n
health_element = sdk.health_element.create_health_element_blocking(
    sdk.health_element.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(
        base=DecryptedHealthElement(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            note="Example",
        ),
        patient=created_patient
    )
)`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

### Api and entity *flavours*

Modifying and retrieving encryptable entities in iCure is straightforward: you can use the `get` and `modify` methods
provided by the iCure SDK without worrying about encryption, because the SDK will automatically handle encryption and
decryption of the entities.

This however comes at a cost: decrypting and encrypting entities takes some time, and you don't always need to do it.
For example if in your application you don't encrypt the codes on a patient you can get the patient, modify the codes,
and update the patient without decrypting and then re-encrypting it.

To cover these use cases the api and entities come in different "flavours".

For each encryptable entity the sdk provides 3 different types: a decrypted type (e.g. `DecryptedPatient`), an encrypted
type (e.g. `EncryptedPatient`), and a polymorphic type (e.g. `Patient`). These types are de-facto identical, the
division exists only to support the development of applications by providing better type checking.

:::info

Depending on the language the SDK represents the polymorphic type of an encryptable entity either represented as a
**union** of the encrypted and decrypted type, or by an **interface** with the two concrete implementations.

:::

Similarly, the api for each encryptable entity comes in 3 flavours. Most methods that you can access directly from the
api take/return the decrypted flavour of the entity, but you can use the `encrypted` and the `tryAndRecover` properties
to access versions of the api that work with the encrypted and polymorphic flavours of the entity, respectively.

:::note

Not all methods of the main api are available in the `encrypted` and `tryAndRecover` variants, since some methods such
as the creation of a new entity don't really make sense in multiple flavours: when you create a new entity it will be
originally decrypted (you are not going to encrypt it yourself), and it will be encrypted by the sdk before sending it
to the backend.

:::

The following table summarises the behaviour of the flavours of the api

|                             | Input                                                                                                                                                                                   | Output                                                                               | Example use case                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decrypted                   | Encrypts the entities, fails if not possible for some entity.                                                                                                                           | Decrypts the entities, fails if not possible for some entity.                        | You need to access the encrypted content of an entity                                                      |
| Encrypted                   | Best-effort validation to verify that the entities do not contain any data which should be encrypted according to the configuration. Fails if some entity does not pass the validation. | Returns the entities as is.                                                          | You don't need the encrypted content of an entity                                                          |
| Polymorphic (tryAndRecover) | Encrypts or validate the entity depending on the actual type. Fails if some entity can't be encrypted or does not pass validation.                                                      | Tries to decrypt the entities, any entity that can't be decrypted is returned as is. | You don't know if the user can decrypt the entity but you want to display as much information as possible. |



<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`encrypted_patient = sdk.patient.encrypted.get_patient_blocking(created_patient.id)
maybe_decrypted_health_element = sdk.health_element.tryAndRecover.get_health_element_blocking(health_element.id)
# You can check if the health element was decrypted by using \`isinstance\`
health_element_is_decrypted = isintance(maybeDecryptedHealthElement, DecryptedHealthElement)`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

:::warning

The validation of encrypted input performed by the encrypted and polymorphic flavours of the apis are best-effort and
may not always be accurate. There are some edge cases where you can perform illegal changes to an entity and end up with
a seemingly valid entity (e.g. adding nested services with no content in an encrypted service). Without decrypting the
final entity, or without having a list of changes it is impossible for the SDK to detect the issue.

The objective of this validation is only to help identify mistakes in the logic of your application, and you should not
rely solely on it for validation. For example, instead of allowing your user to freely modify an encrypted entity and
then passing the updated entity to the api wrapping the call in a `try catch` you should just prevent the user from
modifying the fields that need to be encrypted.

:::

### Searching for entities

You can use *Filters* to search for entities that have some specific characteristics.

To create filters you can use the builders provided for each type of entity. With the builder you can provide some
conditions that all entities returned by the filter methods need to satisfy. You can also combine multiple conditions
as *intersection*, which means that the filter will only return entities that satisfy all conditions, or as *union*,
which means that the filter will return entities that satisfy at least one of the conditions.

Additionally, when building an intersection filter you can specify one search condition to also be used as a sorting
key.

In the following example we build a filter that returns all patients that have john in the name and are born between
the 1st January 1990 and the 31st December 1999, sorting them by date of birth. You can refer to the code documentation
on the builders to learn more about the available filters.

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`from icure.filters import PatientFilters\n
john_filter = PatientFilters.Builder(sdk).contains_fuzzy("john").date_of_birth_between(
    from_date=19900101,
    to_date=19991231,
    sort=True
).build()`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

You can use the filters by passing them to the *filter* methods in the respective api. The result of a filtering
operation is an iterator, which can be used to retrieve all entities matching the filter in pages.

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`filter_iterator = sdk.patient.filter_patients_by_blocking(john_filter)
print(filter_iterator.next_blocking(100))`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

### Encrypted entity links

Encrypted links are used to represent one-to-many relationship between entities in a secure yet still usable way.

The encrypted link works by using *secret ids*. For each entity that can be on the *one* side of a one-to-many
relationship we have a *secret id*, which is stored encrypted in the entity itself. This secret id will be added to the
*many* linked entities, allowing for any user with access to the secret id of the *one* entity to search for the linked
entities.

:::note

It is possible for a single entity to have multiple secret ids, which is useful in cases where you want to better
separate the health data of patients that needs to be accessible to different groups of data owners. This however is
a more advanced topic and won't be covered in this page.

:::

You can use filters to find the *many* entities linked through secret ids to a *one* entity, for example you can create
a filter to get all the health elements linked to a patient in the following way:

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`from icure.filters import HealthElementFilters\n
health_elements_for_patient_filter = HealthElementFilters.Builder(sdk).by_patients([created_patient]).build()`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

In addition to the secret id we also encrypt and add the normal id of the *one* entity on each of the *many*. This value
is kept separate from the other encrypted content of the entity in order to allow for the sharing of only the full
entity content without sharing the linked entity or vice-versa. This could be useful for example if a doctor wants to
share some exam results without sharing the patient they belong to.

You can use sdk methods to decrypt a linked entity id from an entity when you need it (it will not be automatically
decrypted like the entity content), for example to get the id of the patient that a health element refers to:

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`# A list containing the id of the patient if it could be decrypted, or empty if the current user can't decrypt it
patient_of_health_element = sdk.health_element.decrypt_patient_id_of_blocking(health_element)`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

### Sharing an existing entity

You can share entities with other data owners even after the entity creation. You can do this by using the `share`
method in the api of that entity.

When sharing an entity with another data owner you will at least give them read access to the unencrypted content of the
entity. Additionally, you can give:
- Access to the encrypted content
- Write access to the entity
- Access to the encrypted id of an entity linked by an encrypted link (if the entity is on the *many* side of the one-to-many relationship)
- Access to some specific secret id of the entity (if the entity is on the *one* side of an encrypted link for a one-to-many relationship)

<SdkCode>
    <Python>
{`from icure.model import RequestedPermission, ShareMetadataBehaviour\n
# Get the secret ids of the patient
patient_secret_ids = sdk.patient.get_secret_ids_of_blocking(created_patient)
shared_patient = sdk.patient.share_with_blocking(
    other_data_owner,
    created_patient,
    PatientShareOptions(
        # Share the provided secret ids
        share_secret_ids=patient_secret_ids,
        # Share the encryption key of the patient if available to the current user
        share_encryption_key=ShareMetadataBehaviour.IfAvailable,
        # Share the entity with write permission if the current user has write permission, read permission otherwise
        requested_permissions=RequestedPermission.MaxWrite
    )
)
shared_health_element = sdk.health_element.share_with_blocking(
    other_data_owner,
    health_element,
    HealthElementShareOptions(
        # Share the encryption key of the health element, failing if not available to the current user.
        share_encryption_key=ShareMetadataBehaviour.Required,
        # Do not share the patient id linked to the health element (even if the current user can access it).
        share_patient_id=ShareMetadataBehaviour.Never,
        # Share the entity with write permission, failing if the current user does not have write permission.
        requested_permissions=RequestedPermission.FullWrite
    )
)`}
    </Python>
</SdkCode>

## Working with non encryptable entities

After understanding how to work with encryptable entities the usage of non-encryptable entities api methods should be
quite straightforward. The main changes on the non-encryptable entities are:
- There is no encryption metadata, so you can use the create entity methods using a newly constructed instance
- There is no flavours of api
- There are no share methods, since access control is role-based
