# Typescript

To use the Cardinal SDK in Typescript, you can install it using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @icure/cardinal-sdk
```
You can also use npm:
```bash
npm install @icure/cardinal-sdk
```

We strongly recommend using [strict null checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictNullChecks) when 
developing your application.

:::note

To use the Cardinal SDK on node, you need node 19 or greater.
