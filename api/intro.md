# Introduction

## What is iCure API ?

The iCure API is the cloud based components that is responsible for storing and serving medical data. It allows you to save your data into the databases and manage the access control to it based on the access
rules you defined in your solution.

*iCure* is a trustable service ensuring the privacy of your patient medical data thanks to [end-to-end encryption](../ehr-lite-sdk/explanations/encryption/introduction),
meaning your users are the only ones who decide who can access their data.

You are not supposed to access the iCure API directly; you should use one of our SDKs instead :
- The **EHR Lite SDK** takes care of the [end-to-end encryption / decryption](../ehr-lite-sdk/explanations/encryption/introduction)
  of your data and proposes you a series of easy-to-use services for the building of EHR like solutions.
- The **Medtech SDK** takes care of the [end-to-end encryption / decryption](../medtech-sdk/explanations/encryption/introduction)
  of your data and proposes you a series of easy-to-use services for the creation of apps targeted for medical devices.
