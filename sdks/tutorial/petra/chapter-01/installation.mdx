# Installation

In this section, we will see how to clone the project and launch the tutorial application.

## 1. Clone the project

To begin, you need to clone the tutorial project. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:icure/icure-medical-device-react-native-app-tutorial-template.git
```
Alternatively, create a repository from the [tutorial template](https://github.com/icure/icure-medical-device-react-native-app-tutorial-template), more information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## 2. Install dependencies

Once the project is cloned, you need to install the project dependencies. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

## 3. Install pods (iOS only)

If you want to run the application on iOS, you need to install the pods. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn run pod-install
```

### In case of issue with pod installation

During the writing of this tutorial, we encountered an issue with pod installation.

#### Ruby version issue

During the installation of XCode, it is possible that you installed a version of Ruby that is not compatible with the version required by ReactNative. In this case, we suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install a version of Ruby required by the project.

Often, once the Ruby version is installed, we had to execute this command to be able to install the pods:

```bash
cd ios && bundle install && cd ..
yarn run pod-install
```

## 4. Launch the application

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to launch the application to verify that everything is correct. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ios"
    values={[
        {label: 'iOS', value: 'ios'},
        {label: 'Android', value: 'android'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="ios">

```bash
yarn run ios
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android">

```bash
yarn run android
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
