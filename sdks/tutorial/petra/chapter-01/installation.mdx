# Installation

In this section, we will see how to clone the project and launch the tutorial application.

## 1. Clone the project

To begin, you need to clone the tutorial project. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:icure/icure-medical-device-react-native-app-tutorial-template.git
```
Alternatively, create a repository from the [tutorial template](https://github.com/icure/icure-medical-device-react-native-app-tutorial-template) (More information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)).

## 2. Install dependencies

Once the project is cloned, you need to install the project dependencies. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

## 3. Install pods (iOS only)

If you want to run the application on iOS, you need to install the pods. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn run pod-install
```

### In case of issue with pod installation

During the writing of this tutorial, we encountered an issue with pod installation.

#### Your Ruby version is X.X.X, but your Gemfile specified X.X.X

If you installed XCode on your machine, it is possible that it installed as well a version of Ruby which is not compatible with the version required by ReactNative. If that's the case, the following error will output when executing the pod-install yarn command: `Your Ruby version is X.X.X, but your Gemfile specified X.X.X`. 

In this case, we suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install a version of Ruby required by the project.

Once the Ruby version is installed, you will have to install the pods by using this additional command: 

```bash
cd ios && bundle install && cd ..
yarn run pod-install
```

#### version X.X.X is not installed
It is also possible that you don't have the Ruby version used by the tutorial project (See file .ruby-version) installed on your machine. 
You will therefore have the error `rbenv: version 'X.X.X' is not installed`. 

To resolve this issue, use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install the required Ruby version.

#### pod: command not found
When trying to install your pods, you can also get the error `pod: command not found`. 
To resolve this issue, you have to install the cocoapods gem using: `sudo gem install cocoapods`. 

#### Could not find ... in locally installed gems
Pod-install command can also leads you to a similar error message: `Could not find cocoapods-1.11.3, ... in locally installed gems`. 

To resolve this issue, you will have to install the bundle manually to install the missing gems. 
For this, execute the following command: 
```bash
cd ios && bundle install && cd ..
```


## 4. Launch the application

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to launch the application to verify that everything is correct. To do so, open a terminal and run the following command:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ios"
    values={[
        {label: 'iOS', value: 'ios'},
        {label: 'Android', value: 'android'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="ios">

```bash
yarn run ios
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android">

```bash
yarn run android
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's now configure your first iCure solution.
