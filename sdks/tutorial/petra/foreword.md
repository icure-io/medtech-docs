# Petra: The Tutorial

Welcome to iCure! If you haven't had the chance to read the [Introduction](../../intro.md) yet, we invite you to do so before continuing to learn more about what iCure is and specifically what iCure MedTech is.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a medical application with iCureMedTech for patients. Specifically, we will create a menstrual cycle tracking application. This application will allow patients to add menstrual cycle tracking data, view it, and optionally share it with their doctor.

Given the nature of this tutorial, we will only focus on the features of the application and not on its design. A Github repository is available with all the frontend code as well as the different visuals you will need during this tutorial.
