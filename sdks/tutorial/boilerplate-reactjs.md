# ReactJS Boilerplate

To make it easier for you to take the first steps in integrating iCure, we have prepared a boilerplate app for you to quickly start your project.

This project includes the following technologies:

* [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
* [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* iCure MedTech SDK

The boilerplate app is a simple application that has already the registration and login flows implemented.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:icure/icure-medical-device-react-js-boilerplate-app-template.git icure-reactjs-template
