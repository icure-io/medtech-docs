# Introduction to encryption

iCure uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure that only the intended recipients can read sensitive data.
The iCure SDKs encrypt and decrypt sensitive data on the client-side (end-to-end), to insure the sensitive data
travelling over the internet and stored in our servers cannot be read by any third party.
This also includes us: the keys necessary to decrypt the sensitive data are stored only on the client side, therefore we
won't be able to read the sensitive data we receive.

## Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography: basics

The end-to-end encryption scheme in iCure uses standard symmetric (AES-256) and asymmetric (RSA-2048) cryptography
algorithms.

Symmetric cryptography algorithms use a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt the data: if you want to share data
with other users using symmetric cryptography, you will first have to agree on this key.

Asymmetric cryptography algorithms instead use pairs of keys. Each pair is composed of a `private key`, which must be
kept secret, and a `public key`, which can be safely shared with anyone. Data encrypted using the public key can be
decrypted only by using the corresponding private key. So if *Bob* wants to share a secret message with *Alice* he can
encrypt the message using *Alice*'s public key, and only she will be able to read it.

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages: symmetric encryption is orders of magnitude faster than asymmetric
encryption, and it can be used to share data with multiple participants at the same time.
However, if the participants don't share the key over a secure channel a malicious third party may be able to intercept
it, compromising the confidentiality of the data.
For this reason a common pattern is to use asymmetric encryption to share the key used for the symmetric encryption of
the confidential data.
In iCure we also follow this pattern to ensure that we can keep data confidentiality without sacrificing too much in
terms of performance.

## iCure encryption scheme: objectives {#objectives}

The design of the iCure encryption model is based on the following objectives:

- Data owners can access the sensitive data that they created or that other data owners shared with them. For this
purpose each data owner will have a public+private key pair.

- A data owner should be able to decrypt sensitive data they have access to by knowing only their private key. The full
decryption process requires multiple steps and uses also other keys, but only the private key is required to start
the process.

- A data owner should not be able to decrypt sensitive data that was not shared with them.

- Third parties should not be able to access any kind of sensitive data.

- Third parties should not be able to infer any relationships between entities that may leak sensitive data. For
example, third parties should not be able to understand that a certain patient is having frequent doctor visits. This is
different from the previous objective, which only required third parties to not be able to access sensitive information
of the patient or the reason of the visits.

- If a data owner loses access to their private key but shared sensitive data with other data owners they should be able
to regain access to this data.

<!-- The following chapters explain how iCure's encryption scheme achieves these objectives. -->
We will soon update this documentation with more details on how iCure uses these cryptographic algorithms to protect the
users' data.
