# Introduction to encryption

iCure uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure that only the intended recipients can read sensitive data.
The iCure SDKs encrypt and decrypt sensitive data on the client-side (end-to-end), to insure the sensitive data
travelling over the internet and stored in our servers cannot be read by any third party.
This also includes us: the keys necessary to decrypt the sensitive data are stored only on the client side, therefore we
won't be able to read the sensitive data we receive.

## Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography: basics

The end-to-end encryption scheme in iCure uses standard symmetric (AES-256) and asymmetric (RSA-2048) cryptography
algorithms.

Symmetric cryptography algorithms use a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt the data: if you want to share data
with other users using symmetric cryptography, you will first have to agree on this key.

Asymmetric cryptography algorithms instead use pairs of keys. Each pair is composed of a `private key`, which must be
kept secret, and a `public key`, which can be safely shared with anyone. Data encrypted using the public key can be
decrypted only by using the corresponding private key. So if *Bob* wants to share a secret message with *Alice* he can
encrypt the message using *Alice*'s public key, and only she will be able to read it.

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages: symmetric encryption is orders of magnitude faster than asymmetric
encryption, and it can be used to share data with multiple participants at the same time.
However, if the participants don't share the key over a secure channel a malicious third party may be able to intercept
it, compromising the confidentiality of the data.
For this reason a common pattern is to use asymmetric encryption to share the key used for the symmetric encryption of
the confidential data.
In iCure we also follow this pattern to ensure that we can keep data confidentiality without sacrificing too much in
terms of performance.

## iCure encryption scheme: principles {#objectives}

A good way to understand the way encryption works in iCure is to understand what we want to achieve by using e2e
encryption for the protection of your data.
We designed the iCure encryption model based on the following principles:

- Each data owner has a personal asymmetric encryption key-pair. Only the data owner itself has access to the private
  key.

- A data owner can create data, encrypt its sensitive content, and share that piece of data with other data owners.

  - Only data owners that have been granted access to a piece of data are allowed to retrieve it from the iCure server.

  - The encrypted content of a piece of data should be decryptable only by the data owners that have been granted access
    to it.

  - Third parties should not be able to decrypt the content of a piece of data not shared with them, even if they could
    retrieve the encrypted data from iCure's server. These third parties include iCure and other legitimate data owners
    that have been granted access to the data.

- The only secret required by a data owner in order to decrypt some sensitive data shared with him should be his own
  private key. The full decryption process may involve other secrets, but they should all be derived only from the
  private key and non-secret data retrievable from the iCure server.

- It should not be possible to infer sensitive data just by observing the encrypted data. For example, it should not be
  possible to understand that *patient Charlie* is having frequent doctor visits, not even if the purpose of the visit
  can't be inferred.

As previously mentioned in iCure we use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to achieve these goals.
