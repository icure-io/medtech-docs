# Notification

A Notification is a request by a [Data Owner](/sdks/glossary#data-owner) for a Healthcare Professional to perform a 
particular action, such as sharing a piece of information.  
Since the Notification is encrypted, only the responsible Healthcare Professional can see its content.

## When Should I Use a Notification?

You should use a Notification when a Data Owner needs a Healthcare Professional to perform an action and wants to 
be sure that no one else can access to the request.

## How a Healthcare Professional is Related to Other Entities?

Any Data Owner can create a Notification.  
A Notification will be shared with a Healthcare Professional.  
A Healthcare Professional can modify a Notification shared with them.

## Examples

### A Doctor Receives a Data Sharing Request

After a visit, a Doctor register the symptoms the Patient is experiencing (fatigue) as a new Data Sample.  
Then, they add the diagnosis (hay fever) as associated Healthcare Element.

<!-- file://code-samples/explanation/doctor-shares-data-with-patient/index.mts snippet:doctor shares medical data-->
```typescript
const healthcareElement = await api.healthcareElementApi.createOrModifyHealthcareElement(
  new HealthcareElement({
    description: 'My diagnosis is that the patient has Hay Fever',
    codes: new Set([
      new CodingReference({
        id: 'SNOMEDCT|21719001|20020131',
        type: 'SNOMEDCT',
        code: '21719001',
        version: '20020131',
      }),
    ]),
  }),
  patient.id,
)
const dataSample = await api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    content: {
      en: new Content({
        stringValue: 'The patient has fatigue',
      }),
    },
    codes: new Set([
      new CodingReference({
        id: 'SNOMEDCT|84229001|20020131',
        type: 'SNOMEDCT',
        code: '84229001',
        version: '20020131',
      }),
    ]),
    healthcareElementIds: new Set([healthcareElement.id]),
  }),
)
```

Then, the Patient sends a Notification to the doctor to ask for access on the data.

<!-- file://code-samples/explanation/doctor-shares-data-with-patient/index.mts snippet:patient sends notification-->
```typescript
const accessNotification = await patientApi.notificationApi.createOrModifyNotification(
  new Notification({
    id: uuid(),
    status: 'pending',
    author: patientUser.id,
    responsible: patientUser.patientId,
    type: NotificationTypeEnum.OTHER,
  }),
  user.healthcarePartyId,
)
```

After that, the Doctor receives a notification from the Patient and shares the data with them.

<!-- file://code-samples/explanation/doctor-shares-data-with-patient/index.mts snippet:doctor receives notification-->
```typescript
const newNotifications = await api.notificationApi.getPendingNotifications()
const newPatientNotifications = newNotifications.filter(
  (notification) =>
    notification.type === NotificationTypeEnum.OTHER &&
    notification.responsible === patientUser.patientId,
)

if (!!newPatientNotifications && newPatientNotifications.length > 0) {
  await api.healthcareElementApi.giveAccessTo(healthcareElement, patient.id)
  await api.dataSampleApi.giveAccessTo(dataSample, patient.id)
  await api.notificationApi.updateNotificationStatus(newPatientNotifications[0], 'completed')
}
```
