## What is iCure for EHR Lite ?
{{/ehrlite}}

*iCure* is a trustable service ensuring the privacy of your patient medical data thanks to [end-to-end encryption](explanations/encryption/introduction.mdx), 
meaning your users are the only ones who decide who can access their data.

{{#medtech}}
iCure lets you focus on the core features that are going to make your medical device solution successful: the user experience of your app, your algorithm, â€¦ while offloading to us the management of your data store, the monitoring of your solution, the release management of the apis, the security of the data.

iCure acts as a complete backend for your EHR solution and provides you with a very flexible data model that provides a high level of customisation while guaranteeing that interoperability in standard formats like FHIR will be straightforward.

iCure helps you manage the encrypted data by providing a series of easy-to-use tools :   
- The **iCure API** allows you to save your data into the databases and manage the access control to it based on the access 
rules you defined in your app.
- The [**iCure Cockpit Web Portal**](../cockpit/intro) allows you to create your solutions, your databases and 
your admin users in your iCure environment.
- The **iCure Client SDKs** takes care of the [end-to-end encryption / decryption](explanations/encryption/introduction.mdx) 
of your data and proposes you a series of easy-to-use medical-oriented services.
- The **Interoperability components** helps you to connect with external services by mapping the iCure Data Model to 
standard models like FHIR.
