# Start your React JS App

## What includes this template ?
- All dependencies needed to use the [iCure MedTech Typescript SDK](https://github.com/icure/icure-medical-device-js-sdk) in a React Native App
- First implementation of the authentication flow (Registration / Login)
- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
- [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

## Requirements
The following tools need to be installed on your machine:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Clone the template
To create your React Native App using the iCure MedTech template, execute the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:icure/icure-medical-device-react-js-boilerplate-app-template.git my-icure-app
cd icure-reactjs-template && yarn
```

At the end of the process, you should have something similar to this:

## Start app
Go to your new app directory `cd my-icure-app` and start the app on a web browser by running the command `yarn run start`.

Once it finishes, you should be able to see the Login Page with the logo of iCure. But before completing an authentication, you will have to :
Complete the values of `.env` file (Provide tutorial doc for that)


And that's it !
