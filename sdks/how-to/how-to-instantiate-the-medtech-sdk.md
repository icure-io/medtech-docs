# Instantiate the MedTech SDK using the asynchronous DSL
You can obtain an instance of the MedTech SDK by either using the [MedTechApiBuilder](sdks/references/classes/MedTechApiBuilder.md) or the 
[AnonymousMedTechApiBuilder](sdks/references/classes/AnonymousMedTechApiBuilder.md). You should use the former when you have
the username and the password of the user you want to authenticate and the latter when you want to register a new user 
or generate a temporary authentication token for an existing user. All these procedures are described more in details in 
the [user authentication how to](sdks/how-to/how-to-authenticate-a-user/index.md).
