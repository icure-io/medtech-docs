# Sharing data automatically with other data owners

iCure allows to share data between different data owners, as explained in the guide 
[How to share data between data owners](/sdks/how-to/how-to-share-data), however this requires to perform an explicit request every time
we want to share a new entity. 

In some cases you may need to always share all data created by a data owner with other data-owners, for example you may
want to always share all data created by a patient with their general practitioner. 
In these situations it may be more convenient to use the automatic-sharing feature of iCure. 

:::note

In the following examples we use different instances of `MedTechApi`s, to perform the requests as different users.
The api we use are `hcp1Api` and `hcp2Api` to act as two different healthcare practitioners data owners (`hcp1` and
`hcp2`, respectively) and `pApi` to act as a patient data owner (`p`).

:::

## Start sharing data with another user

You can use the `shareAllFutureDataWith` method from the `userApi` to start sharing all new data the user creates with
another user.
The following example shows how to automatically share all new entities which will be created by `hcp1` with `hcp2`. 

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:auto share-->
```typescript
await hcp1Api.userApi.shareAllFutureDataWith('medicalInformation', [
  hcp1Api.dataOwnerApi.getDataOwnerIdOf(hcp2User),
])
```

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:sample creation-->
```typescript
const note = 'Winter is coming'
const patient = await hcp1Api.patientApi.createOrModifyPatient(
  new Patient({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Snow', note }),
)
// hcp2 can already access patient
const contentString = 'Hello world'
const dataSample = await hcp1Api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    labels: new Set([new CodingReference({ type: 'IC-TEST', code: 'TEST' })]),
    content: { en: { stringValue: contentString } },
  }),
)
// hcp2 can already access dataSample
```
</details>

## No automatic share on modify

The automatic data sharing applies only on entity creation, and not on modification. If a user is sharing data with 
another user and modifies an entity that is not yet shared with that user the updated entity won't automatically be 
shared with them.

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:not on modify-->
```typescript
const contentNotOnModify = "Won't automatically update who the data is shared with on modify"
const dataSampleNotOnModify = await hcp1Api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    ...existingDataSample,
    content: { en: { stringValue: contentNotOnModify } },
  }),
)
```

## Uni-directional

Note that the auto-share is uni-directional: if `hcp1` is automatically sharing data with `hcp2` it does not mean that
`hcp2` will automatically data with `hcp1`. Anything created by `hcp2` won't be accessible to `hcp1` until `hcp2` shares
it.

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:one directional-->
```typescript
const contentNotSharedBy2 = 'Hcp 2 is not sharing automatically with 1'
const dataSampleNotSharedBy2 = await hcp2Api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    labels: new Set([new CodingReference({ type: 'IC-TEST', code: 'TEST' })]),
    content: { en: { stringValue: contentNotSharedBy2 } },
  }),
)
```

## Stop sharing

You can stop the automatic data share using the `stopSharingDataWith` method.

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:stop auto share-->
```typescript
await hcp1Api.userApi.stopSharingDataWith('medicalInformation', [
  hcp1Api.dataOwnerApi.getDataOwnerIdOf(hcp2User),
])
```

<details>
    <summary>Data creation example</summary>

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:sample no share-->
```typescript
const contentNotSharedAnymore = 'Hcp 1 stopped sharing data automatically with 2'
const dataSampleNotSharedAnymore = await hcp1Api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    labels: new Set([new CodingReference({ type: 'IC-TEST', code: 'TEST' })]),
    content: { en: { stringValue: contentNotSharedAnymore } },
  }),
)
```
</details>

## Non-retroactivity

Both the `shareAllFutureDataWith` and `stopSharingDataWith` methods are not retroactive. This means that when a user
starts sharing data with another user they will not give access to already existing data, and when they stop sharing 
data they will not revoke access to shared data.

## Applicable to all data owners

Any data owner can automatically share data with any other data owner, regardless of their type (patient, healthcare 
professional, or medical device).

## No chaining of automatic data share

The automatic data sharing applies only to entities created by the user which is sharing the data. If `hcp1` shares all 
data with `p` and `p` shares all data with `hcp2` when `hcp1` creates a new entity it will only be shared with `p`, and
not also with `hcp2`.

<!-- file://code-samples/how-to/auto-share/index.mts snippet:share chain-->
```typescript
await hcp1Api.userApi.shareAllFutureDataWith('medicalInformation', [
  hcp1Api.dataOwnerApi.getDataOwnerIdOf(pUser),
])
await pApi.userApi.shareAllFutureDataWith('medicalInformation', [
  pApi.dataOwnerApi.getDataOwnerIdOf(hcp2User),
])

const contentNoChaining =
  "Even if hcp1 shares with p and p shares with hcp2, hcp2 won't have automatic access to the data"
const dataSampleNoChaining = await hcp1Api.dataSampleApi.createOrModifyDataSampleFor(
  patient.id,
  new DataSample({
    labels: new Set([new CodingReference({ type: 'IC-TEST', code: 'TEST' })]),
    content: { en: { stringValue: contentNoChaining } },
  }),
)
```
